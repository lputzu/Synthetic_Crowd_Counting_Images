# Synthetic_Crowd_Counting_Images

Here, you can find some some single-scene synthetic image data sets for training scene-scpecific crowd counting models, including:
  - Mall
  - UCSD
  - PETSview1
  - PETSview2
  - PETSview3

The images are obtained by extracting the background images from 3 well known data sets (Mall, UCSD and PETS2009), and then placing synthetic individuals as explained in details in our works (see Section References). For PETS2009, which originally is not a single-scene data set, we divided the images into three groups (we grouped the images belonging to the same camera), which brought to three different views: PETSview1, PETSview2 and PETSview3.
